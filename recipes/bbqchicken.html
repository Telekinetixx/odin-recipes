<h2>These BBQ tenders have a barbecue base but are elevated with a decidedly Asian influence. I use Savory Spice Asian Delight BBQ Rub, which is different from Chinese five-spice.</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>⅓ cup barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's® Hickory & Brown Sugar)</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons Asian-flavored barbeque seasoning (such as Savory Spice® Asian Delight BBQ Rub)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon caramel sauce</li>
    <li>1 pound chicken tenders</li>
</ul>


<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. </li>
    <li>Stir together barbeque sauce, barbeque seasoning, and caramel sauce in a shallow dish until combined. Reserve 2 tablespoons mixture for basting. </li>
    <li>Dip each chicken tender into barbeque sauce mixture; coat thoroughly. Place in the prepared casserole dish. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Baste with reserved sauce and bake 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
</ol>
