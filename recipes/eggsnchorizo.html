<h2>This chorizo and egg dish is an appetizing breakfast with spicy flavor. My Mexican husband taught me this simple and delicious recipe that serves 2 people, and I use no more than 6 eggs for both of us. You might use less or more â€” it doesn't matter.</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cooking Spray</strong></li>
    <li><strong>1/4 cup Mexican-style chorizo, or more to taste</strong></li>
    <li><strong>6 Large eggs</strong></li>
    <li><strong>salt to taste</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Grease a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot skillet until browned, about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Whisk together eggs and salt in a medium bowl until combined; pour over chorizo in the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, about 5 minutes. </li>
</ol>
<h4>You can add whatever you like to this dish because eggs are very versatile. Don't forget about bacon!</h4>
